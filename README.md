# UW TCSS543 - Advanced Algorithms
This course prepares students for analysis and use of advanced algorithms. It covers advanced graph, number theoretical (with applications to cryptography), approximation (with performance guarantees), and probabilistic algorithms, Turing machines, and NP-completeness.

In this final course project, we implemented the basic functionality of elliptic curve cryptography in Java, and apply Pollardâ€™s rho algorithm to compute discrete logarithms on small elliptic curves.
